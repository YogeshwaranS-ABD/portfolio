                <h3>Rooftop Extraction from Aerial Images (Deep Learning)</h3>
                <p>This is my final year project completed by a team of two. This project is about segmenting satellite images using Deep Learning. This project helped me to venture into a new domain Deep Learning. Researched about the state of the art models used for image segmentation. Developed a new variant of an existing model.</p>
                <p>Participated in an IEEE conference and presented a paper about the developed model. Played a key role in model development and making the manuscript.</p>
                <p>Implemented PyTorch framework with seaborn visualization library to record the training and testing metrics of the model. Utilized Flask framework to build a web application that makes project user friendly.</p>
                <p><strong>Technology Stack:</strong> The project utilized a range of technologies, including Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, Flask.</p>

                <h3>Mini-Project: Local Message Broadcasting System</h3>
                <p>Through this project, I practiced the Python programming language to strengthen my skills with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I also added to my experience with Socket Programming, Inter Process Communication (IPC), and Multi Threading with Mutex locks and Semaphores. Finally, I have also gained knowledge of Tkinter, an User Interface framework in Python.</p>

                <h3>Mini-Project: Flexi Cloud</h3>
                <p>I completed this mini project during my training at MagicBus and in preparation for my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. This project is built upon the following tech stack: Python, Flask, and SQLite as Backend, HTML, and CSS as front end. Through my work on this project, I have strengthened my knowledge of various AWS services such as EC2, S3, RDS, VPC, Cloud Formation, EBS, EFS, and ELB.</p>
